# Price Undercutter
Disclaimer: This is work in progress and unpolished, quickly made to be quickly used - not a fancy beutiful code :D


How it works: When you start the app it automatically monitoring your C:\users\%username%\Documents\EVE\logs\Marketlogs
checking for a most recent file. App loads the exported file and find the top price for the selected order type (sell/buy) and copies that price to your system clipboard.
Export files are generated whenever you click "export to file" ingame regional market window. Also there is one filter which is jumps which filters orders according to that.

How to use it: 
1. Start the Price undercutter
2. Start EVE and open regional market with an item you wish to modify order for.
3. Click on "Export to File"
4. Now you have top price in your clipboard so, you can insert the price with "ctrl+v" anywhere you want.
5. You can scroll up/down to modify the top price in your new order to undercut your competitors. (edited)
